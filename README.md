# clock-Alarms
 * I CREATE A CLOCK WITH CURRENT TIME AND ALARMS. Its project using VANILLA JAVASCRIPT, HTML AND CSS
 
# Problem Statement
 * Create an alarm clock. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript.

#Features 
 * Clock face
    Clock showing the current time (seconds,mins,hrs should change as time changes).
 * Set Alarm
    Provide input boxes to set an alarm (hr,min,sec, am/pm).
    Once the sets the time and click “Set Alarm” button, add that alarm to the alarms list below.
    When the alarm goes of just use JS alert function to alert in the browser.
    
 * Alarms list
    Display a list of all the alarms set by user
 * Delete alarm
    For each alarm give a delete button to delete the alarm
    When the user deletes an alarm make sure it “does not alerts the user”
